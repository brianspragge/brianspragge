## Skills

- Speak Bad=English, Python, C, Bash, C++, Zzz's, Git, and sarcasm
- Can’t find my semicolons
- Make bugs look like features since 199x
- Guitar skills and Baduk skills
- Side projects: Started, forgotten, but never finished.  Except Ruler, for vim.
- If it works: It's probably by accident.

## Matters of life and death

- Debugging is slower than running with scissors, and less fun.
- Every great project begins with a TODO and ends with... I can't remember.
- Once solved a bug by eating it.  Try "Nuoc mam"
